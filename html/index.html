<!--
What happened last night?
Are you really here?
Joan, Joan, Joan, Joan, Joan
Hi Joan!
Don’t wake up Joan!
Oh my God, last night
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, last night

I got so excited
I was too enthusiastic
Thank you for not laughing
Well, you laughed a little bit at one point when I was touching you and said I might lose consciousness
Which you said was adorable, and I just have to trust

That you don’t think I’m an idiot or some kind of an animal
I’ve never lost control due to overwhelming lust

But I must
say that I’m
changing my major to Joan
I’m changing my major to sex with Joan
I’m changing my major to sex with Joan
With a minor in kissing Joan

Foreign study to Joan's inner thighs
A seminar on Joan’s ass in her Levi’s
And Joan’s crazy brown eyes

Let’s never leave this room
How about we stay here 'till finals?
I’ll go to school forever
I’ll take out a dementedly huge high interest loan
'Cause I’m changing my major to Joan
